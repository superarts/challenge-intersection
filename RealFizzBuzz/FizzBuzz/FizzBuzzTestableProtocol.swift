/*
 The *ONLY* purpose of this protocol is to fulfil the business requirement that we have to provide 3 zip files, otherwise we would add the following functions to `FizzBuzzProtocol`:

 - getResult: getResultV1
 - getResultWithLucky: getResultV2
 - getResultWithLuckyAndReport: getResultV3

 In a real world, I would talk with business guys to figure out why they want 3 zip files instead of 3 targets / branches etc. and try to work out a better solution, instead of following the requirements blindly.
